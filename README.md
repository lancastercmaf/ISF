International Symposium on Forecasting 2019
=====
The 39th ISF was held in Thessaloniki in Greece. As in past years, a large delegation from the [Centre for Marketing Analytics and Forecasting](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/research/research-centres--areas/centre-for-marketing-analytics-and-forecasting/) attended and presented their latest research. This gitHub repository contains all slides presented at the conference:
